# Client Selection for Unsupervised Federated Time Series Learning with Source-Free Domain Adaptation

This repository contains the implementation of client selection methods for source-free domain adaptation techniques in a federated learning scenario, specifically tailored for time series data.
The primary goal of this work is to address class imbalance in unsupervised federated time series learning.

## Acknowledgements

The client selection part of the codebase is heavily adapted from the work of [euphoria0-0/Active-Client-Selection-for-Communication-efficient-Federated-Learning](https://github.com/euphoria0-0/Active-Client-Selection-for-Communication-efficient-Federated-Learning). We extend our gratitude to the original authors for their foundational work. Implementation of Pow-d and Cluster2 is incomplete.
