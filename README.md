# Client Selection for Unsupervised Federated Time Series Learning with Source-Free Domain Adaptation

This repository contains the implementation of client selection methods for source-free domain adaptation techniques in a federated learning scenario, specifically tailored for time series data.
The primary goal of this work is to address class imbalance in unsupervised federated time series learning.
